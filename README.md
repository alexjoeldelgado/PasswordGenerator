# PasswordGenerator
This application will create a password with User Generated criteria.

## Description
The Password Generator will ask the user to input the desired length of the password. It will then ask whether or not to include Special Characters, Numerical Characters, Uppercase Characters, or Lowercase Characters. If incorrect parameters were chosen (such as a number outside the given range or no Character Set), the page will reset the function and re-ask the prompts. Once the password is generated, it will be displayed in the text box and will be able to be copied to the user's clipboard should the user desire it.
